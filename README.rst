FitLog
======

FitLog is a personal app which aims at log your fitness activity.

You can create your programs, which is a group of exercices with sets and reps.

By logging your sets and reps, you can build stats & graphs to see if you are
in the right direction or not.

Sure there is a ton of apps which already do this??

In fact, we want it as simple as possible, mostly with a lightweight interface
for mobile devices. We want to log it quicky from everywhere (desktop, laptop,
whatever) otherwise... we won't do it!
